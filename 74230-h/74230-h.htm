<span class="i0">I had always felt contented about that ghost,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There in her vine-shrouded house aside of the road;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I knew that the rag-stuffed panes were her special boast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That she liked the tumble-down chimney of her abode;<br></span>
<span class="i0">She liked that old hat that hung in the tree in the lane,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the scarecrow leaves that dribbled around in the rain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The ivy that muffled the sills, a ghost would adore,<br></span>

<span class="i0">In this glittering, piece-work world that can run a home;<br></span>

<span class="i0">No wonder the black mole tunnels the garden loam;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And there is revelry under her knotted boards<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where wild kittens hide and the grey squirrels rattle their hoards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span>”<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But some eager, figeting, worldlings came one day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Moved into the house on a heavenly morning in May;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of course the ghost could do nothing but move away....<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, the cutting and hammering, planing and scrubbing and suds,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, the paint and the polish, the grates and the curtains and duds!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The new-new beds, the cleanness and trimness and all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I looked for the ghost in the mirror that shone in the hall;<br></span>

<span class="i0">Though the pale grey thing may really have cared that I knew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">At all events, she moved ... and her shadowy store<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of belongings exists for the world no more....<br></span>

<span class="i0">Upon the warm brick walls the patterns come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dim moving likenesses of pensive leaves;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The swallows twitter round the ivied eaves<br></span>
<span class="i0">Late bees in perilous petunias hum;<br></span>
<span class="i0">On the moors, amber grape and bloomy plum,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But here in trim back-yards the apple’s face<br></span>

<span class="i0">Soundlessness on the hills is silver-furled!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Now all faint scents and spice of full increase!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The scarlet pepper pendant on its bush<br></span>

<span class="i0">Once more has come upon the Islander.<br></span>

<span class="i0">The old church clock strikes one, and down the row<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of ancient houses where the moonlight floods,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The black tree branches move like wands that throw<br></span>
<span class="i0">A net of woven loopings flecked with buds.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The night is still, a silver quiet now<br></span>
<span class="i0">Transforms the plain old homes whose ancient mood<br></span>
<span class="i0">Returns; through panelled doorways come and go<br></span>
<span class="i0">Figures soft shod, in prim calash and hood;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here by a lilac bush the little gate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Supports two figures of sweetheart and beau<br></span>
<span class="i0">Here by a hedge two others hesitate<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then join the shadowy thronging too and fro.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do you believe that in those rooms upstair<br></span>
<span class="i0">The newer generation dreams again<br></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the lives of all these women and men<br></span>
<span class="i0">Setting them free to haunt the pavements here?<br></span>
<span class="i0">That youngsters sleeping see sails homeward fare,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ships laden with treasure and salt romance;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Quakers’ broad brim; Puritans askance?<br></span>
<span class="i0">That such bold dreaming sets these spirits free<br></span>
<span class="i0">On this deserted street in moonlit beam<br></span>
<span class="i0">“Coming alive,” though coming soberly<br></span>
<span class="i0">And looking on us as figures in <b>their</b> dream?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_120">{120}</a></span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Hush, with what proud simplicity these figures move<br></span>
<span class="i0">And live again austerities of grace<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who used their lives so guardedly&mdash;this glove<br></span>
<span class="i0">The homespun petticoat! this barbe of lace!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Boots and prunellas on the brick path pace;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair tinted skin, clear eye and honored name<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come through the panelled doors or garden place.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The scholars’ reserve, the solid merchants’ fame<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Friends, the Captains, blooded knight and dame,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who to old English gentry backward trace.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So through the cobbled streets they silently press<br></span>
<span class="i0">On very gentle errands of their own<br></span>
<span class="i0">And make no plea, and no proud tale confess<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor look aghast at their once simple town<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet do they smile, permitting us to guess<br></span>
<span class="i0">That they prefer their own to our renown....<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Was that the clock just struck ... the street is clear<br></span>
<span class="i0">The moon rides high, there are no figures here....<br></span>
<span class="i0">Someone stopped dreaming in this street, my dear!<br></span>

<span class="i0">If I were starving in Nantucket I would first<br></span>
<span class="i0">Go down to the beach and dig for quahaugs;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or some scallops.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or drop overboard a neat little lobster car,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or row to a place where there are wild oysters;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then I would hang around the docks at five o’clock<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the fishermen come in,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And perhaps get an extra plaicefish<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or some shark or black fish,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Though I shouldn’t like to eat horseshoe crab or squid)<br></span>
<span class="i0">That failing, I would go out on the moors and snare a pheasant;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would catch a rabbit and though I wouldn’t know how to cook it, an owl.<br></span>
<span class="i0">To eat crow, I have heard is not judicious&mdash;but how about marsh-hawk?<br></span>
<span class="i0">If it were August I would get Irish moss out of the sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And flavor it with cranberries.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would then go crabbing near Our Island Home;<br></span>
<span class="i0">If it were July I should live in the blueberry patches<br></span>
<span class="i0">And find black berries, (you know where!)<br></span>
<span class="i0">And get strawberries in the old cemetery.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would go mushrooming (very prudently) in fields near Thorn Lots.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">{122}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">I would go beach plumming (very early) on the State Road<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would get in touch with grape vines near Wauwinet<br></span>
<span class="i0">And with hazel nuts near ’Sconset<br></span>
<span class="i0">And dig for swamp root out near Madaket.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Elder berry would be a last resort!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would hang over the fences of a certain yard in Hussey Street<br></span>
<span class="i0">To see if grapes and pears would come to me.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or I would interrupt tea-parties on Pleasant Street<br></span>
<span class="i0">Boldly walking in and asking for apples.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of course I would weed the potato patch of anyone that asked me to<br></span>
<span class="i0">For two potatoes.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I would help with the melons and do what I could for corn and pumpkins;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Peaches and cherries I would pluck on shares<br></span>
<span class="i0">But if all these things failed I would go to a little house,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where they always know what I mean<br></span>
<span class="i0">And ask for food!<br></span>
